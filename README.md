# 🐢 SDP ROS Turtlebot Template

This is a template repository for using Turtlebots and ROS. It contains a setup script that sets up all the boilerplate to get your Turtlebot up and running.

## Usage
- `./install.sh` - Sets up a catkin workspace, installs dependencies, and sets up bashrc on both DICE and the Turtlebot.
- After installation, you can quickly ssh into your Turtlebot with macro `turtleshell`
